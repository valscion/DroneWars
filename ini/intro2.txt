Lets take a look at the star 8221 Arietis.|
It has a planetary system of couple planets,|
New Pallas, New Titania and Asherah.|
all of these are owned by the infamous|
Kano-Am HC, and used for multiple purposes.|
OAA sent a droid to Kano-Am HC Drone Military|
Outpost on New Pallas. The outpost was guarded|
pretty weakly, and so a tiny droid of OAA Engineering|
has been able to slip trough the defences.|
||
You are in charge of controlling and|
keeping it well supplied.|
||
Your mission:|
Do what ever it takes to get information|
about Kano-Am factories!|

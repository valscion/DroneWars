The Galaxy Monocerotis 7331 is inhabited|
by many races of different lifeforms, and|
they have built companies that compete|
between each other, in the art of building|
helpful droids. There are many companies,|
but two stand out as the biggest, and most| 
competiting companies. First, and currently|
bigger is the Kano-Am Heavy Cybernetics,|
which controls with brutal overpower.|
The smaller, but in many ways friendlier company,|
Original Automatic Artificial Engineering,|
collecting fans with quality, not power.|
As soon as K-A HC heard of a competing,|
and pretty powerful company, it started tearing|
it apart. OAA Engineering got together and|
built a droid, that could infiltrate and destroy|
Kano-Am.

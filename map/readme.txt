|How to create your own maps?|
+----------------------------+

Well, that's easy. Firstly, you create folder
for your map set, for example "MyMapSet".
Next, you start making your maps and name them
as you like, but remember, the maps will be
ordered alphabetically;
AsteroidMap.map
SteroidMap.map
...and so on. Same comes with numbering them:
map01.map
map02.map and so on.

Now, when you've made your maps and have them
in right order, the next thing you have to do
is to create ini-data for them in the
"mapsets.ini":

[mapset1]
name="My Epic Map Set"
folder="MyMapSet
maps=N

As you can see, the section of this set is
[mapset1], since there's no mapsets done before
it, except the official one, [mapset0], by me.
The variable "maps" is for the amount of maps.
So in this case, as I don't know how many maps
you made, I put an 'N' there to represent your
amount of maps. :-)



Happy mapping!
